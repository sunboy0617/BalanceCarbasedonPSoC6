# BalanceCarbasedonPSoC6
清华大学自动化系2018级大二暑假小学期“现代电子系统设计”大作业工程源码--基于PSoC6的多功能平衡车

Final Project of Course "Contemporary Electronic System Design" in Tsinghua University.

In this project, we created a two-wheel balance car based on PSoC6, which could be controlled by a PC console. It was able to move forward or backward, turn left or right and just stop. It could be controlled by voice. You can even use its camera to scan a QR code!

Codes about PSoC programming are in /BalanceCar_PSoC, codes about PCConsole programming are in /BalanceCar_PCConsole.

We use PSoC Creator 4.2 and python 3.7.0 on Windows 10 to carry out our project.
